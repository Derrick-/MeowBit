#### v0.4 for XP : March 17, 2014

## Description
MeowBit is Free Software for Windows with the goal to allow you to effortlessly view Dot-Bit websites as registered in the [Namecoin](http://namecoin.info) blockchain.

[Dot-Bit](http://meowbit.com/what-is-dot-bit/) is a new top-level domain that is not controlled by any government or corporation.

Anyone can [register a Dot-Bit domain](http://meowbit.com/how-to-register-dot-bit-domains/) in minutes using the inexpensive cryptocurrency, [Namecoin](http://namecoin.info).

Dot-Bit domains are extremely resistant to being shut down or hijacked by governments, corporations or criminals.

With MeowBit you can navigate on any browser from the regular web to Dot-Bit sites and back, effortlessly and securely.

## Installation, Getting Help & Tips
### Requirements
 * Windows XP
 * [NET Framework 4 Client Profile](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17113)
 * Framework Updates:
  * PREFERRED: All .Net 4.0 Updates from Windows Update on your stat menu.
  * OR: [Update 4.0.3 for Microsoft .NET Framework 4 – Runtime Update](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29053)
  * OR (Minimal): [Update to .NET Framework 4 KB2468871](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3556)
 * Namecoin Wallet software running. [Get it here](http://namecoin.com).


### Installation
 * Run MeowBitSetup.exe
 * Ensure Namecoin wallet is installed and running, and the blockchain is up-to-date.
 * Run MeowBit for the first time to configure the service and connection to the namecoin client.
 * After installation, MeowBit may display a button that says "Install Service", "Set Auto Start", or "Start Service".
 * Once MeowBit is running and all status indicators are green, you should be able to browse dot-bit sites.
 * You may need to restart your browser the first time you use MeowBit.

### Known Issues
 * The following apply to Windows 7 and prior. Windows 8 is not affected.
  * If you are getting a dynamic IP address automatically from a local DHCP server (like your router) but you have specified specific DNS servers, MeowBit will set your DNS server to automatic on exit. This is because Windows does not have a way to detect if your DNS servers are automatically obtained when using a dynamic IP address.
  * You may not be able to view dot-bit sites via MeowBit when connected to a VPN service. Results vary, this will be addressed in a future version.
 
### Getting Help
 * Please leave a clear and detailed comment on our [help forum](http://meowbit.com/forums/) if you have any issues with any aspect of running MeowBit. We like bug reports.

### Tips
 * This version is designed specifically for Windows XP users. If you are using Windows 7 or better, please download the [latest version here](http://meowbit.com/download-and-install/). If you are using Windows Vista, ask for your money back, this version of Windows may be compatible, but will not be supported.
 * If you were viewing Dot-Bit domains before MeowBit using the clunky and insecure alternate-DNS servers workaround, change back to your old default DNS servers before installing MeowBit.
 * MeowBit resolves .bit domains using the namecoin blockchain on your PC. Namecoin must run long enough for the blockchain to be downloaded from other wallets on the network. There are prominent status indicators that show this progress.
 * MeowBit auto-starts at Windows start-up, this can be changed by removing the MeowBit shortcut from the start-up folder.
 * To work seamlessly, you also should configure the Namecoin wallet to start at start-up. This option is available in the Namecoin Wallet settings.
 * If you get a message that says “Namecoin config updated. restart wallet”, restart wallet and wait a few minutes.
 * If you are upgrading from a previous version, uninstall the old version first. Click on desktop kitty to open MeowBit monitor. Stop Service. Go into system tray. Right-click on kitty, exit MeowBit. Go to Windows Start / Control Panel, Programs and Features / click MeowBit to uninstall. Then you can install new version.
